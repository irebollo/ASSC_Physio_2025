%% Power spectrum, channel selection
% Compute the EGG power spectrum for all channels and select the channel
% with the strongest peak between 0.033 and 0.067 Hz.

[FFT_EGG,figure_fft] = compute_FFT_EGG(EGG_raw);

%% Filtering
% Filter the raw EGG from the selected channel around the dominant
% frequency to extract the gastric rhythm using a finite impulse response
% filter (Matlab FIR2), with a banwith of +/- 0.015 Hz of the peak
% frequency.
% Also compute phase of the gastric cycle and the amplitude envelope of the
% filtered EGG, using the Hilbert method.
